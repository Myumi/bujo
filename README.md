What is a "Bujo"?
------
A *bujo* is shorthand for _bullet journal_ which is a type of planner that you make yourself, structured around the idea that "with great lists, come great power".

The word _bullet_ comes from _bullet points_ (luckily), as this is the basis for organization. 

Personally, I love my bujo. I write down daily tasks, travel ideas, my random ideas, and so on. I think they're very handy and soothing to use.

Project Goals
------
For my first ever React project, I wanted something simple that I would personally find use in. I wanted to learn how to use the framework efficently, write clean and readbale code, and have the state persist between browser sessins.

I feel I succeeded in this goals.

Plans
------
This project is very barebones. If I have time in the future I would love to expand on it with:
- A smart calendar feature which saves your lists from the past days, allows you to create lists in future days, and proudly displays your lists from the current day
- Themes/More color schemes
- "Types" of tasks (such as having a reminder, without a time attached) 
- Time blocking (like Google Calendar, but better)

Run This
------
You will need git and npm installed.
```
git clone https://github.com/myumi/bujo
npm start
```
